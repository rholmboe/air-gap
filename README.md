# air-gap Kafka to Kafka Topic Transfer over UDP with Guaranteed Delivery

This project aims to solve the problem of transferring events from a Kafka topic in near real time over an unsecure UDP connection with guaranteed once-only delivery of the events. This can be useful, e.g., for transmitting log events over a hardware diode. The information leaving the sending side may be encrypted with symmetric keys and the key exchange is automatic with use of public key encryption.

## Overview

In Kafka, events may have a key and a value. The key part of events upstreams will be lost in the transmission, since the key part downstream is used for message identification and thus detection of lost messages (gap-detection). 

For resend of lost events that gap-detection identifies, a back channel must be present but can be a manual routine with input from keyboard or from a file transfer. The information is mainly what topic, partition and id to start reading from. The easiest way to do that is to use the create-resend-bundle application that reads the Kafka Gap topic and creates a file with the missing events. The file needs to be copied to upstream and then used with the resend-missing application that reads the missing events and transmits them again to the UDP receiver.

## Quick Start

1. **Clone and build:**
	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/anders-wartoft/air-gap.git
	cd air-gap
	make all
	```
This will build the upstream and downstream binaries as well as the Kafka Streams Java application for deduplication.

2. **Run a local test (no Kafka required):**
	- Edit `config/upstream.properties` and `config/downstream.properties` as needed (set `targetIP` to your local IP).
	- In one terminal:
	  ```bash
	  go run src/cmd/downstream/main.go config/downstream.properties
	  ```
	- In another terminal:
	  ```bash
	  go run src/cmd/upstream/main.go config/upstream.properties
	  ```
	- You should see messages received in the first terminal.

3. **Next steps:**
	- Connect to real Kafka by editing the config files.
	- Enable encryption by setting `publicKeyFile` and related fields.
	- See the rest of this README and [Deduplication.md](doc/Deduplication.md) for advanced usage, gap detection, and production deployment.
    - More help for setting up encryption to Kafka can be found here: [Kafka-encryption.md](doc/Kafka-encryption.md)

## Notation
There are four executable files that together constitutes the transfer software.
- Upstream - on the sending side of the diode, also used as the name of the program that consumes Kafka events and produces UDP packets
- Downstream - on the receiving side of the diode, also used as the name of the program that receives UDP packets and produces Kafka events for the receiving Kafka
- gap-detector - The program that consumes the freshly written Kafka events from Downstream and looks for missing events. This will also deduplicate the events, so if an event is received more than once downstream, only the first of these will be delivered
- set-timestamp - This progam consumes information from the gap-detector and instructs the sending upstream process to restart at an earlier point in time in the upstream Kafka event stream so the lost events may be sent again

To use guaranteed delivery, you must be able to copy information from the gap-detector that runs downstream to the set-timestamp program that runs upstream. The information that needs to traverse the diode in the wrong direction is basically a topic id, partition id and position for the first lost event. set-timestamp is an application that uses that information, queries Kafka upstream on the last timestamp before that event and configures the upstream application to start reading at that timestamp.

N.B., neither the configuration files nor the key files are not shown in the above image.

upstream reads from a Kafka topic specified in the upstream configuration file. It then enrypts the data and sends it over the UDP connection, that might include a hardware diode. Packets that are more than MTU in size (with header) will get fragmented and sent as several UDP packets. Downstream listens to UDP packets, performs defragmentation and decryption of the content and writes to a Kafka instance and topic specified in the downstream configuration file.

Downstream Kafka contains three topics: one that downstream writes to, that is read by the deduplicator and saved as a deduplicated stream of events. Any missing events are identified by the key they should have by the gap-detector and those gaps are reported to the third Kafka topic downstream.
The first topic may contain duplicates but the one from the deduplicator should very rarely contain duplicates. Consume the gap-detector output topic, and send to your SIEM of choice. The data sent from Kafka upstream to Kafka downstream is treated as bytes and not strings, so any string encoding in upstream should be present in the final Kafka topic. Binary data, like files and images are also acceptable payloads to the downstream Kafka.

## Getting started
### Very simple use case
To enable users to get started without Kafka and without hardware diode, use the following properties files:
- upstream.properties
- downstream.properties

These properties files are configured for getting a few random strings instead of reading from Kafka and to send with UDP without encyption. Change the targetIP in upstream3.properties to the one you would like to send to. The targetIP in downstream3.properties is set to 0.0.0.0 so it will bind to all local addresses.

In one terminal, start the server with:
```bash
go run src/cmd/downstream/main.go config/downstream.properties
```

In a new terminal, start the client (sender) with:
```bash
go run src/cmd/upstream/main.go config/upstream.properties
```
A few messages should now be sent from upstream and received by downstream. From here, add encryption and connections to Kafka to enable all features.

## Principle of Transmission
### Upstream
Upstream has two main purposes, to read events from the upstream Kafka, and to send the events to the UDP receiver. Since the UDP transmission may be insecure, we may encrypt the events using symmetric AES256 in GCM mode. The key is generated on startup, and at configurable intervals. The key is also sent over the UDP transmission to the receiver, encrypted with the receiver's public key, that we store in a file upstream. To change the public key, it should suffice to add a new key and change the configuration file to point to the new key. When the next key generation is set, the new key will be used instead of the old.

The encryption is only enabled if the `encrypted` property is set to true and the `publicKeyFile` is set to the downstream public certificate pem file.

### Downstream
Downstrem should receive UDP data (encrypted and unencrypted) and write events to the downstream Kafka on a configured topic. When upstream starts, cleartext events will be generated, as well as an encrypted key (if encryption is enabled). The cleartext messages should be forwarded to the downstream Kafka, key exchange messages should be handled internally and encrypted messages should be decrypted and then forwarded to the downstream Kafka.

On downstream startup, a file glob is read from the configuration file. When a key exchange message is received, the file glob is used to load all private key files that matches the glob. The encrypted message is decrypted with all the private keys until one succeeds. To know if an encryption was successful or not, the symmetric key that upstream sends is prepended with a known string before encryption, a so called guard. When the decrypted message starts with the guard, the rest is used as the new symmetric key. Downstream writes the events to the downstream Kafka with the upstream Kafka topic name, partition id and position as the downstream key. The name of the downstream Kafka topic downstream writes to is configurable. That topic is then consumed by gap-detection.

#### Performance
UDP receive is normally faster than Kafka writes. The downstream application tries to safeguard against lost packets by using a lightweight thread that receives events, decrypts them using AES256 (quite fast) and then adds the events to an array. Another thread consumes the array and writes to Kafka using the async protocol (that also returns immediately and processes the write in yet another thread). If the performance is not enough, first try to add nodes to the Kafka cluster and add the nodes to the bootstrapServers configuration in the downstream process. You can also try to add several events together before writing them to the upstream Kafka, since there is some overhead for each Kafka event, especially for writing. As a last resort, the upstream sender can be set to throttle (eps property), e.g., by adding a small time.Sleep after each sent event. You should be able to securely transmit tens of thousand events every second using one transmission chain, but for large installations you might have to add more sender/receiver chains, as well as upgrade the Kafka instances.

### Automatic resend
Since UDP is an unreliable protocol, you can set up air-gap to automatically resend logs at specific time intervals. In the upstream property file, add the following property:
`sendingThreads=[{"Name": seconds-delay}, ... ]`

Example:
```bash
groupID=testGroup
sendingThreads=[{"now": 0}, {"3minutes-ago": -180}]
```
For each name-dealy, a thread will be created in upstream. Each thread connects to Kafka with a group name that consists of the groupID from the property file, a "-" character, and the name from the sendingThreads property. In the example above, two threads will be created. One named "now" with 0 seconds delay and one named "3minutes-ago" with 180 seconds delay.

The thread with name "now" will connecto to Kafka with a group id of "testGroup-now" and the other thread "testGroup-3minutes-ago".

When a thread reads a message in Kafka, it will check if the Kafka timestamp - the delay (delay is a negative number) is at least equal to, or greater than, the current time. If not, it will sleep until the time is right to send.

If a message is read but not delivered (because the thread is sleeping) and the application terminates, then the

### Deduplication and Gap Detection
This is covered in the [Deduplication.md](doc/Deduplication.md) documentation

### Using Gap Detection Events to Resend from Upstream
TBD


## Keys
Generate keystore with certificate or obtain otherwise.
```bash
keytool -genkey -alias keyalias -keyalg RSA -validity 365 -keystore keystore.jks -storetype JKS
```

Export the java keystore to a PKCS12 keystore:
```bash
keytool -importkeystore  -srckeystore keystore.jks  -destkeystore keystore.p12  -deststoretype PKCS12 -srcalias keyalias
```

Export certificate using openssl:
```bash
openssl pkcs12 -in keystore.p12  -nokeys -out cert.pem
```

Export unencrypted private key:
```bash
openssl pkcs12 -in keystore.p12  -nodes -nocerts -out key.pem
```

Now, add the cert.pem to upstream (public key) and the
key.pem to downstream. Downstream can have several private keys,
if all of the filenames are covered by the same file glob

## Encryption
The provided solution encrypts data in transit over the UDP connection. If needed, add TLS and authentication to all the Kafka connections. If the event generation is also secured with Kafka TLS, then no part of the event chain needs to be in clear text.

For information about Kafka and TLS, see e.g., https://dev.to/davidsbond/golang-implementing-kafka-consumers-using-sarama-cluster-4fko

## Configuration
### Upstream
The upstream OS must be configured for static route and arp for the ip address used to send UDP. Upstream will need both a public key and a configuration file with the following properties:

```bash
id=Upstream_1
nic=en0
targetIP=127.0.0.1
targetPort=1234
source=kafka
bootstrapServers=192.168.153.138:9092
topic=transfer
groupID=test
# The from parameter will issue a new kafka client id
# and search from the beginning of the topic until the
# insert time for the event is at least this time, then
# start to emit the events. Handy for resending of events
# format for from=2024-01-28T10:24:55+01:00
from=
publicKeyFile=certs/server2.pem
# Every n seconds, generate a new symmetric key
generateNewSymmetricKeyEvery=500
# Read the MTU from the nic, or set manually
mtu=auto
```

All configuration can be overridden by environment variables. In the case a file is parsed that will be parsed first and may result in configuration errors. After that, any environment variables are checked and, if found, will overwrite the file configuration.

The environment variables are named as:
```bash
AIRGAP_UPSTREAM_{variable name in upper case}
```
Example:
```bash
export AIRGAP_UPSTREAM_ID=NEW-ID
export AIRGAP_UPSTREAM_NIC=ens0
export AIRGAP_UPSTREAM_TARGET_IP=255.255.255.255
...
```

### Removed settings
| Config file property name | Environment variable name | Default value | Description |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|---------------|-------------|
| source                   | AIRGAP_UPSTREAM_SOURCE   |               | Source could be 'kafka' or 'random'. 'random' created dummy data instead of getting the data from Kafka. |

Resend will receive a major overhaul so this section is now deprecated:

The same configuration file is used for set-timestamp. set-timestamp uses the bootstrapServers to query for timestamps for each topic partition and position in the set-timestamp arguments. When the earlierst timestamp has been retrieved, the configuration files's from parameter is set to that timestamp. When upstream restarts, it will read all Kafka events from the beginning and discard those before the from timestamp. During the start phase, set-timestamp will revert the from parameter to an empty string so the next startup will use Kafka's stored pointer for where to read from in the future. 

### Downstream
Downstream has a similar configuration file as upstream

```bash
id=Downstream_1
nic=en0
targetIP=127.0.0.1
targetPort=1234
bootstrapServers=192.168.153.138:9092
topic=log
privateKeyFiles=certs/private*.pem
target=kafka
verbose=true
mtu=auto
clientId=downstream
```

The property privateKeyFiles should point to one or more private key files that will be tried in decrypting key exchange events from upstream.

It controls how much incoming UDP data the kernel can buffer for the application before packets are dropped due to the application not reading fast enough. |

### Configuration
numReceivers can be set to 10 or more to bind several threads to the same port. The kernel will distribute the events evenly (at least if the numReceivers is divisable by 5). If two downstream are started with the same configuration, the second started will act as a hot stand-by.

For high throughput on high-end servers, set the numReceivers, channelBufferSize, batchSize, readBufferMultiplier and rcvBufSize to:

#### High-volume UDP-Kafka receiver configuration example
```bash
id=Downstream_HighPerf
nic=enp1s0                # Use a high-performance NIC if available
targetIP=0.0.0.0          # Bind to all interfaces
targetPort=1234           # Use your desired UDP port
bootstrapServers=192.168.153.138:9092
topic=log
privateKeyFiles=certs/private*.pem
target=kafka
mtu=auto
clientId=downstream
logLevel=INFO
logFileName=downstream.log
```

#### High-performance tuning parameters:
```bash
numReceivers=10               # Number of UDP receiver goroutines (match to CPU cores)
channelBufferSize=65536       # Size of Go channel buffer between UDP and Kafka. Large buffer to absorb UDP bursts.
batchSize=128                 # Number of messages to batch per Kafka write. Larger batches improve Kafka throughput.
readBufferMultiplier=32       # User-space UDP read buffer (mtu * multiplier). Larger user-space buffer for big UDP packets.
rcvBufSize=16777216           # OS UDP socket buffer (16 MiB). Large OS buffer to minimize packet loss under load.
logStatistics=5               # Log stats every 5 seconds
```

To test the UDP sender/receiver, use the normal binaries with the following configuration:
```bash
downstream config/downstreap-perf.properties

upstream config/upstream-perf.properties
```

This will generate events automatically in upstream, with a sequence number, send those to downstream that will discard the events but count how many was received and time from first receive to Ctrl-C. Terminate downstream when you don't want to measure any longer and the eps and total number of received events will be displayed. Terminate upstream after downstream.

### Deduplicator and Gap Detector
Deduplicator and Gap Detector is covered in the [Deduplication.md](doc/Deduplication.md) documentation


### Logging
All code uses the log logging packets. To be able to write the most important logs to a file, a new variable, Logger, is introduced, that can accept a file name from the configuration. Important events that can be delivered in the output of the code (event stream) are also sent into the event stream.

# Possible Problems
Some problems that may arise are:
- The UDP sending fails. Check that you have static arp (arp -s) and route (ip route add) enabled.
- If the UDP connection is very unstable, then condider using two instances of upstream/downstream sending the same information over two different hardware diodes to the same Kafka and the same topic. Duplicates should be removed by the gap-detection so the result should be a more stable connection.

# Service
The applications responds to os signals and can be installed as a service in, e.g., Linux.

- **`build/variables.mk`** - Common variables and paths
- **`build/go.mk`** - Go binary compilation (upstream, downstream, create, resend)
- **`build/java.mk`** - Java deduplication application build
- **`build/package.mk`** - Package creation with nfpm (RPM, DEB, APK)
- **`build/test.mk`** - Test execution and validation

All binaries are built to `target/linux-amd64/` by default, and packages are created in `target/dist/`.

### Manual Build

To build manually without Make:

```bash
# Go applications
cd src/cmd/upstream
go build -o upstream main.go

# Java application
cd java-streams
mvn clean package
```

## Packaging

The project includes production-ready system packages for major Linux distributions using [nfpm](https://nfpm.goreleaser.com/):

### Package Formats

- **RPM** - For RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, Rocky Linux, AlmaLinux
- **DEB** - For Debian, Ubuntu
- **APK** - For Alpine Linux

### Package Contents

Each package includes:
- Compiled binaries installed to `/usr/local/bin/`
- Systemd service files for easy daemon management
- User/group creation (`airgap` user)
- Configuration templates
- Automatic dependency installation

### Package Testing

Docker-based package testing is available in the `tests/` directory:

```bash
# Start test containers
cd tests
docker-compose up -d

# Test RPM packages on Rocky Linux
docker-compose exec rocky bash /scripts/test-rpm.sh

# Test DEB packages on Ubuntu
docker-compose exec ubuntu bash /scripts/test-deb.sh

# Test APK packages on Alpine
docker-compose exec alpine sh /scripts/test-apk.sh

# Cleanup
docker-compose down
```

### Installation

After building packages with `make package-all`, install them on your target system:

**RPM-based systems:**
```bash
sudo dnf install target/dist/airgap-upstream-*.rpm
sudo dnf install target/dist/airgap-downstream-*.rpm
sudo dnf install target/dist/airgap-dedup-*.rpm
```

**DEB-based systems:**
```bash
sudo apt install ./target/dist/airgap-upstream_*_amd64.deb
sudo apt install ./target/dist/airgap-downstream_*_amd64.deb
sudo apt install ./target/dist/airgap-dedup_*_amd64.deb
```

**Alpine:**
```bash
sudo apk add --allow-untrusted target/dist/airgap-upstream-*.apk
sudo apk add --allow-untrusted target/dist/airgap-downstream-*.apk
sudo apk add --allow-untrusted target/dist/airgap-dedup-*.apk
```

## Run the upstream and downstream applications as Linux services (systemd)
To turn the application into a service we need to create a service file: `/etc/systemd/system/upstream.service`
Change the paths to where you will install the service binary and comfiguration file

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Upstream AirGap service
ConditionPathExists=/opt/airgap/upstream/bin
After=network.target
StartLimitIntervalSec=60

[Service]
Type=simple
User=root
Group=root
LimitNOFILE=1024
StandardOutput=append:/var/log/airgap/upstream/stdout.log
StandardError=append:/var/log/airgap/upstream/stderr.log

# Set min and max memory (in bytes, e.g., 256M min, 1G max)
MemoryMin=256M
MemoryMax=1G

Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=10

WorkingDirectory=/opt/airgap/upstream
ExecStart=/opt/airgap/upstream/bin/fedora-upstream /opt/airgap/upstream/upstream.properties

# make sure log directory exists and owned by syslog
PermissionsStartOnly=true
ExecStartPre=/bin/mkdir -p /var/log/airgap/upstream
ExecStartPre=/bin/chown root:root /var/log/airgap/upstream
ExecStartPre=/bin/chmod 755 /var/log/airgap/upstream
SyslogIdentifier=root

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

You can also use the environment variables for configuration.
Example systemd service file (`/etc/systemd/system/upstream.service`):

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Upstream AirGap service (env config)
ConditionPathExists=/opt/airgap/upstream/bin
After=network.target
StartLimitIntervalSec=60

[Service]
Type=simple
User=root
Group=root
LimitNOFILE=1024
StandardOutput=append:/var/log/airgap/upstream/stdout.log
StandardError=append:/var/log/airgap/upstream/stderr.log

ExecStart=/opt/airgap/upstream/bin/fedora-upstream

```

**Notes:**
- You can set any configuration parameter using the `AIRGAP_UPSTREAM_*` environment variables.
- `MemoryMin` and `MemoryMax` are systemd ResourceControl options (see `man systemd.resource-control`). For Go binaries, these set cgroup memory limits (like Java's `-Xms`/`-Xmx`).
- Remove the `configfile.properties` argument from `ExecStart` when using only environment variables.


### Enable serice and start
```
sudo systemctl enable upstream.service
sudo systemctl start upstream
```

### Downstream
Downstream can be run as a service in the same manner as upstream.

### Create
The `create` application is used to create resend bundle files that contain information of missing events. The bundle should be transferred to the upstream network and consumed by the `resend` application. This application can not be run as a service. The application will terminate when the gaps are exported to the file.

### Resend
The `resend` application is used to either consume resend bundles created by the `create` application, or resend everything from a specified timestamp. The application can not be run as a service. The application will terminate when the information has been resent for all partitions.

## Dependencies
air-gap uses IBM/sarama for the Kafka read/write. For other dependencies, check the go.mod file.

# Release Notes

## 0.1.5-SNAPSHOT
* Multiple sockets with SO_REUSEPORT for faster and more reliable UDP receive in Linux and Mac for downstream. Fallback to single thread in Windows.
* `create` application to create resend bundle files downstream
* `resend` application to resend missing events from the resend bundle created by `create`
* `compressWhenLengthExceeds` setting for upstream and resend to compress messages when length exceeds this value. As of now gzip is the only supported algorithm.
* More configuration for upstream and downstream for buffer size optimizations
* Upstream and downstream can translate topic names to other names. Useful in multi source and/or target setups.
* Statistics logging in upstream, downstream and dedup

## 0.1.4-SNAPSHOT
* Changed the logging for the go applications to include log levels. Monitoring and log updates. 
* Documented redundancy and load balancing (see doc folder)
* Documented resend (future updates will implement the new resend algorithm)

## 0.1.3-SNAPSHOT
* Added a Kafka Streams Java Application for deduplication and gap detection. Gap detection not finished.
* Added upstreams filter to filter on the offset number for each partition (used in redundancy an load balancing setups)
* Added a topic name mapping in downstream so a topic with a specified name upstream can be written to another topic downstream (used in redundancy an load balancing setups)
* Added documentation for the new features.
* Added JMX monitoring of the deduplication application. Added system monitoring documentation

## 0.1.2-SNAPSHOT
* All configuration from files can be overridden by environment variables. See Configuration Upstream
* UDP sending have been made more robust
* Transfer of binary data from upstream to downstream is now supported
* Sending a sighup to upstream or downstream will now force a re-write of the log file, so you can rotate the log file and then sighup the application to make it log to a new file with the name specified in the upstream or downstream configuration.
* air-gap now supports TLS and mTLS to Kafka upstream and downstream. 

## 0.1.1-SNAPSHOT
### Several sending threads
air-gap now supports several sending threads that all have a specified time offset, so you can start one thread that consumes everything from Kafka as soon as it's available, one that inspects Kafka content that was added for an hour ago and so on. See Automatic resend above.
